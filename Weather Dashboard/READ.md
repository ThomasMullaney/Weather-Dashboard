Interactive weather dashboard
The program should be able to take user input and display 
weather statistics based off of location input. 

The app should also take inputs and save them as buttons so that they can be recalled 
from local storage. 

UV index should be interactive and change color based on its level. 
Icons should also be pulled. 

at the moment my code does not function and Does not call upon the API.
